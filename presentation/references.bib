  abstract  = "By collaborating with others, humans can pool their limited
               knowledge, skills, and resources to achieve goals that outstrip
               the abilities of any one person. What cognitive capacities make
               human collaboration possible? Here, we propose that collaboration
               is grounded in an intuitive understanding of how others think and
               of what they can do-in other words, of their mental states and
               competence. We present a belief-desire-competence framework that
               formalizes this proposal by extending existing models of
               commonsense psychological reasoning. Our framework predicts that
               agents recursively reason how much effort they and their partner
               will allocate to a task, based on the rewards at stake and on
               their own and their collaborator's competence. Across three
               experiments (N = 249), we show that the belief-desire-competence
               framework captures human judgments in a variety of contexts that
               are critical to collaboration, including predicting whether a
               joint activity will succeed (Experiment 1), selecting incentives
               for collaborators (Experiment 2), and choosing which individuals
               to recruit for a collaborative task (Experiment 3). Our work
               provides a theoretical framework for understanding how
               commonsense psychological reasoning contributes to collaborative
               achievements. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights
