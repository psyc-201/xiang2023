               knowledge, skills, and resources to achieve goals that outstrip
               the abilities of any one person. What cognitive capacities make
               human collaboration possible? Here, we propose that collaboration
               is grounded in an intuitive understanding of how others think and
               of what they can do-in other words, of their mental states and
               competence. We present a belief-desire-competence framework that
               formalizes this proposal by extending existing models of
               commonsense psychological reasoning. Our framework predicts that
               agents recursively reason how much effort they and their partner
               will allocate to a task, based on the rewards at stake and on
               their own and their collaborator's competence. Across three
               experiments (N = 249), we show that the belief-desire-competence
               framework captures human judgments in a variety of contexts that
               are critical to collaboration, including predicting whether a
               joint activity will succeed (Experiment 1), selecting incentives
               for collaborators (Experiment 2), and choosing which individuals
               to recruit for a collaborative task (Experiment 3). Our work
               provides a theoretical framework for understanding how
               commonsense psychological reasoning contributes to collaborative
               achievements. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights

abstract = {Humans explain and predict other agents’ behavior using mental state concepts, such as beliefs and desires. Computational and developmental evidence suggest that such inferences are enabled by a principle of rational action: the expectation that agents act efficiently, within situational constraints, to achieve their goals. Here we propose that the expectation of rational action is instantiated by a naïve utility calculus sensitive to both agent-constant and agent-specific aspects of costs and rewards associated with actions. In four experiments, we show that, given an agent’s choices, children (range: 5–6year olds; N=96) can infer unobservable aspects of costs (differences in agents’ competence) from information about subjective differences in rewards (differences in agents’ preferences) and vice versa. Moreover, children can design informative experiments on both objects and agents to infer unobservable constraints on agents’ actions.}

abstract={Social loafing is the tendency for individuals to expend less effort when working collectively than when working individually. A meta-analysis of 78 studies demonstrates that social loafing is robust and generalizes across tasks and S populations. A large number of variables were found to moderate social loafing. Evaluation potential, expectations of co-worker performance, task meaningfulness, and culture had especially strong influence. These findings are interpreted in the light of a collective effort model that integrates elements of expectancy-value, social identity, and self-validation theories.

  abstract = "Previous research has suggested that people tend to engage in
              social loafing when working collectively. The present research
              tested the social compensation hypothesis, which states that
              people will work harder collectively than individually when they
              expect their co-workers to perform poorly on a meaningful task.
              In 3 experiments, participants worked either collectively or
              coactively on an idea generation task. Expectations of co-worker
              performance were either inferred from participants' interpersonal
              trust scores (Experiment 1) or were directly manipulated by a
              confederate coworker's statement of either his intended effort
              (Experiment 2) or his ability at the task (Experiment 3). All 3
              studies supported the social compensation hypothesis.
              Additionally, Experiment 3 supported the hypothesis that
              participants would not socially compensate for a poorly
              performing co-worker when working on a task that was low in
              meaningfulness.",

abstract={As reported in summary form by W. Moede (1927), an unpublished study found that in a rope-pulling task, while collective group performance increased somewhat with group size, it was less than the sum of the individual efforts (IE). IE decreased as group size increased. The present 2 experiments with 84 undergraduates investigated this effect using clapping and shouting tasks. Results replicate the earlier findings. The decrease in IE, which is here called social loafing, is in addition to losses due to faulty coordination of group efforts. The experimental generality, theoretical importance, widespread occurrence, and negative social consequences of social loafing are examined, along with ways of minimizing it.
