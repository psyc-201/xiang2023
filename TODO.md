# TODO

(also see new_code/competence_effort/TODO.md and new_code/memo-sandbox/TODO.md)

- [x] make my presentation using quarto
  - [x] use papaja (in both presentation and writeup) to report effects more cleanly (to handle tiny P values more gracefully)

- [x] upload anonymized raw data to github and adjust preproc script(s) to consume it instead
- [x] make a codebook for the anonymized data (explaining each data field)
- [x] create an informative README.md here (linking to OSF component)
- [x] include in this repo's readme how to run the memo sandbox
- [x] clean up report and finish with added sections (see Canvas assignment + linked google doc)
  - [x] standardize tense to past tense
- [x] make OSF component public
- [x] create a README for the OSF component (just point reader to the github repo)
- [-] save preprocessed data as well? or can just keep the original raw data

- [x] make the sanity check plots make the individual trends more clear (hide legend)
- [x] clean up the memo-sandbox/ code a bit more before share with original authors; include in that repo's readme more about how to run it (describe what each file is for, esp. pointing out that the -memo.qmd file is all that is necessary for generating the model fit results. can subtitle the memo-sandbox README as "environment for building up memo models alongside reference examples (both in memo and in webppl)")
- [ ] send to original authors
