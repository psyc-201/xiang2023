- [x] make my presentation using quarto

- [ ] clean up report (see Canvas assignment)
  - [x] use papaja to report effects more cleanly (to handle tiny P values more gracefully)
- [ ] create an informative README.md here, explaining how to run the memo code (linking to OSF component)
- [ ] create a README for the OSF component
- [ ] make a codebook for the anonymized data (explaining each data field)
