# TODO

(also see new_code/competence_effort/TODO.md and new_code/memo-sandbox/TODO.md)

- [x] make my presentation using quarto
  - [x] use papaja (in both presentation and writeup) to report effects more cleanly (to handle tiny P values more gracefully)

- [x] upload anonymized raw data to github and adjust preproc script(s) to consume it instead
- [x] make a codebook for the anonymized data (explaining each data field)
- [x] create an informative README.md here (linking to OSF component)
- [ ] clean up the memo code somewhat to share with original authors, and include in this repo's readme how to run it
- [ ] clean up report and finish with added sections (see Canvas assignment)
- [ ] create a README for the OSF component
- [ ] make OSF component public
